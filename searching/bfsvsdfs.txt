//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Breadth first search

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
Depth first search
//If the tree is very wide:
Breadth first search

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
Depth first search
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
Depth first search
//Finding the shortest path:
Breadth first search

instructor's solution:
//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, 
BFS (DFS will take long time. )

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS

//determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

//Finding the shortest path
BFS
